<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Manifesto

Lenra aims at unifying the following objectives :


Accelerate apps development and distribution: multi-operating system environment, supported hosting and deployment, data management


Address the issues of digital sovereignty: open source technology, hosting within the European Union and independence from GAFAM


Address environmental issues: optimize the environmental impact of apps by optimizing network exchanges and encouraging developers to be sober, limit obsolescence, limit the use of personal data

## Features of the beta version 

For now we only provide Javascript language to code your app, but very soooooon you’ll be able to code in any language !! 

In the beta version, you will have access to several features that will allow you to start developing with our solution. 

You can generate the interface of the application you want to create and the interactions it will have. 

You will also be able to manage user accounts and their data, manage user accounts and their hosting and also manage access authorizations to the application.

## Where is the source code ? 
We are planning to release the source of lenra under the MIT License but we are not ready yet.
We first want to build a great tool that you will like. Only then we will provide you the source code of Lenra.

We already released some of our tools and dependancies under an open source licence and more are coming !
